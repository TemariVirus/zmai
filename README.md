The Zig Mini AI (ZMAI) Library is a miniature machine learning library intented for training tiny models on the CPU (memory bandwidth is likely to become a bottleneck when using the GPU). This library is currently being developed solely to support [Budget Tetris](https://github.com/Zemogus/Budget-Tetris), but may be used as a standalone library as well.
